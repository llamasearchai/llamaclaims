REPLACE THIS FILE WITH A FAVICON IMAGE

You should replace this placeholder with an actual favicon image file.
Recommended formats: PNG or ICO with transparent background.
Recommended size: 32x32 pixels or larger (ideally with multiple sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48).
Recommended filename: favicon.png or favicon.ico

A favicon is the small icon displayed in browser tabs and bookmarks.
It should be a simplified version of your main logo that works well at small sizes.

For LlamaClaims, consider:
- A simplified llama head icon
- The letter "L" in your brand font/style
- A simple document or insurance-related symbol

You can create a favicon using:
1. Online favicon generators
2. Image editing software like GIMP, Photoshop, or Pixelmator
3. Converting your main logo to a smaller, simplified version

Once you have a favicon, replace this text file with the image file
and ensure it's correctly referenced in the mkdocs.yml configuration file.
